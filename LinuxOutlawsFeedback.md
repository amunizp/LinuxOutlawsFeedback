Hi it will problably a long email so I have made an index in case you
want to jump to certain parts kind of like the text walk-through guides
for games, sorry I could not manage the ascii art.

(a) Why is this email so long?
(b) A quote
(c) Thank you!
(d) Open source Libraries (as in the buildings).
(e) Meritocracy in China government?
(f) Excel vs calc vs gnumeric
(g) gwyddion 
(h) ubuntu choice of Mir over wayland
(i) Creative commons films
(j) Thanks for your time!


(a) Why is this email so long?
Hi, I am really sorry about this long email but I have been meaning to
write in for some time: I really like your show. And I listen to it
and take notes of some of the things that I want ask, raise. 


(b) A quote
First my favourite quote from Firefly: [1] 
[Sheriff Bourne has caught Mal returning stolen medicine to a
plague-stricken town] 
Sheriff Bourne: You were truthful back in town.These are tough times. A
man can get a job, he might not look too close at what that job is. But
a man learns all the details of a situation like ours... well... then
he has a choice. 
Mal: I don't believe he does. 


(c) Thank you!
Frankly I do not know if it was you guys of the guys from the Linux
Format Magazine it was two years ago I think. But I discovered Trisquel
OS thanks to one of you and it has been my default OS ever since.
Gnome3 runs nicely on my 5 or 6 year old Acer Aspire One (originally
with Linpus). 
Also, duckduckgo.com. Thank you for commenting on that it
has been my default search engine in any machine or mobile phone.
Integrates nicely in nexus 7. 
Also F-Droid and the replicant project. Thank you for that as well
still did not get around using replicant but f-droid is my default
source of apps. 
Thank you for your introduction to bitcoins, still have not used them
but the replicant project recently received 50 bitcoins from some sort
of bitcoin foundation. With more to come. 

(d) Open source Libraries
If you have not guessed I am UK based I contacted to the Chair of the
arts council Peter Bazalgette and it seems that they have a report that
suggest that open source is the way to go [3]. But it is up to the local
councils to do so. After a conversation in the ubuntu-uk with a very
kind person identified as James Kemp and other mailing list members[4]
I finally did something. Previously I had contacted my local MP but
that is a waste of time. I contacted my ward council person that looks
after the libraries and asked to please consider going for opensource.
Frankly 2 lines is what is needed, mentioning the goverment policy
[2] should explain the rest. Any longer and they will probably bore of
it. I think it is also worth cc in your local councilperson (might be a
different person). I will let you know how I get on. I think it is a
silly thing to do and now that you both pay (via tax) and will probably
vote for your councillor it is any easy thing to do to get the ball
rolling.

(e) Meritocracy in China government?
More off topic: This might be for Fab, just seeking a short opinion on
this interesting TED talk [5]. I am not sure I see a complete flaw on
his way of thinking as I always believed "Democracy was the best of the
worst" Churchill? Plato? I do not recall

(f) Excel vs calc vs gnumeric
I am not going to claim I completely understand this paper [6] but as
far as I got it seems that Gnumeric is better than excel and that excel
is better than libreoffice calc. This last bit I do not understand why
does the libreoffice suite work with the R project and/or gnumeric to
improve their math? 
Also I would like to give some praise to gnuOctave a MatLab
alternative. There was a comparison paper that I cannot find right now
and from what I understood it seems that they came out in a tie on
their benchmark tests: in one Matlab came on top and on others
gnuOctave came on top. 

(g) gwyddion

I would like to set some praise for this Project [7]. It is a bit niche
market: data analysis of scanning probe microscope data (but works with
normal bitmaps as well). Just a little overview as to why this is
awesome: there are several companies that do scanning probe microscopes
(SPM) and in some places they do "home made" microscopes. Each of these
microscopes come with their own data analysis software and each can
only open their own files and they are proprietary software as well.
So if you are collaborating in an international project (or even
national project) it becomes a real mess. In comes gwyddion supported
by the Czech Metrology Institute: it can support virtually any SPM file
format you can throw at it. It is free software, it supports several
languages (I did 10% of the Spanish) and it is multi platform (most of
the other only work on windows). Oh. It does not cost a penny. The
software keeps expanding with new modules just as quickly as the
research needs it. Great job. All they need is more developers and
people to document.  

(h) ubuntu choice of Mir over wayland
So I had a quick look over at why Mir was chosen [8]. I have to be
honest ubuntu was my first stop in the linux world and when the netbook
remix came out I used until they tried the unity stuff and my netbook
became unsuable. Still I could see where they where going and I
absolutely loved it. So when Unity came about it did not seem like a
bad idea, rough around the edges, OK but I found it good. As I
mentioned I like Gnome3 now. I want to have a go at all the addons that
it has. At the moment I changed the default search engine from
wikipedia and google to ddg.gg (I can always search wikipedia with !w).
Having said that I am no fan boy: I like the commitment to freedom that
trisquel has, also I did not like the amazon thing all over unity by
default. Nor did the bit about community members having less
representation. 
But this Mir choice seems like a well thought option making it easier
for use in mobile phones and other platforms? what am I missing?

(i) Creative commons films

Thank you for using Jamendo. As of late I only was re-hearing all that
I has hearing in my teen years partly because I found that it seemed
that the new stuff did not feel new and that it seemed very
"fabricated" thanks to you rat hole radio and jamendo I like music
again. But I thought about doing the same with films and could not find
links, some guys in the trisquel forum suggested this [9] that I had not
heard about and seem pretty good. 
I find these things important on the fight against DRM. Instead of
complaining to the w3 we should stop watching films that have DRM on
them and go for the films that directly don't. In simlar lines tor is an
ebook publisher (sci-fi and fantasy) that are committed to drm free
ebooks.   

(j) Thanks for your time!
keep up the good work!

Hello Outlaws,

I was remembering the second letter I wrote. Sadly I cannot find the first
letter, it was about how zombies might not be able to get past fingerprint 
security measures because a new scanner was in development showing that you need
live skin.

Anyway. I thought it would be a good idea to take you up on the offer as a 
goodbye and create a book out of the feedback I sent you. Given it was so long.
But how about if everybody added to it all the letters they can find and make a 
really big book. Something with the show notes as an introduction for chapters
and maybe some notes of whay you remember. Hell, maybe you can try to do an 
xkcd thing and publish it. See what happens.

Anyway I will try to put this in the gitorius so people can add to it fork or 
whatever. Frankly I do not know the first thin.  Would suggest following the 
recomendation on LinuxVoice and write it on Markdown so that it can be ported to
TeX, ODF, HTML and such. But as some might judge by the document I do not know 
the first thing about MarkDown.

Should be somewhere here:

Good luck!
